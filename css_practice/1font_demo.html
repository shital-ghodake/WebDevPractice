    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>Historical attractions include the 8th century rock-cut Pataleshwar cave temple, the 18th century Shaniwarwada, the 19th century Aga Khan Palace, Lal Mahal and Sinhagad fort. Shinde Chhatri, located at Wanowrie, is a memorial dedicated to the Maratha general Mahadaji Shinde (Scindia).[178] The old city had many residential buildings with courtyards called Wada. However, many of these have been demolished and replaced by modern buildings.</p>

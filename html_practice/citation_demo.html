        <blockquote>
            A body remains at rest, or "in"<q>motion</q> at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.

        <blockquote>
            At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.    
            A   body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
